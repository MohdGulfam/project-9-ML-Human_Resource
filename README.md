HR data can be hard to come by, and HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano and I set out to create our own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of our graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. We created this data set ourselves. We use the data set to teach HR students how to use and analyze the data in Tableau Desktop - a data visualization tool that's easy to learn.
